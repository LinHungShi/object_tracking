    -s: the size (in pixels) of bounding box. 
        Default value is 64.

    -n: number of samples of candidate patches of each frame
        Default value is 50.

    -v: the sampling variance used for generating random patches.
        Default value is 5.0.

    -o: the output directory. If the specified directory does not exist, this
        program will automatically create one. The output images will be
